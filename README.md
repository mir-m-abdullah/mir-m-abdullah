## Projects:

  CNN Model Improvements on Thoracic X-Rays:
  
  This project involved developing and implementing CNN models on thoracic radiological images to predict various pathologies, with a focus on improving model accuracy through the use of binary classification models based on age and gender, as well as pre-processing filters on images, resulting in a final accuracy of 89.2%.
