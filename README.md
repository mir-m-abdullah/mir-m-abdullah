## Projects:

* [Breast Cancer Classification with Machine Learning](https://github.com/mir-m-abdullah/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/Breast%20Cancer%20Detection): A machine learning model to predict whether a breast cancer tumor is malignant or benign, using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the most accurate model and optimized its hyperparameters for better performance. Achieving 98.25% accuracy and 0.98 F1 score, the model can assist physicians in making accurate diagnoses and improving patient outcomes.

* [CNN Model Improvements on Thoracic X-Rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00233): This project involved developing and implementing CNN models on thoracic radiological images to predict various pathologies, with a focus on improving model accuracy through the use of binary classification models based on age and gender, as well as pre-processing filters on images, resulting in a final accuracy of 89.2%.
